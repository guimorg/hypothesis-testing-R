# Statistical tests with R

## tl; dr

Here you are going to find very simple tutorials for performing statistical tests using R.

## Setting up

In order to run these scripts/notebooks you will need to install a few programs on your local machine:

1. R: of course, you will need to have R installed on your system
2. Jupyter: I love working with Jupyter notebooks, although this is not necessarily required, it is nice having Jupyter installed and work with notebooks and multiple languages. Notice that in order to use R you will also need to install the R Kernel for Jupyter, allowing you to start a notebook with R. [This link can help you out.](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/)

One thing you could do would be installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) that will provide you most of the tools you need (especially if you're working in a Windows machine), but you can install it as you want.
