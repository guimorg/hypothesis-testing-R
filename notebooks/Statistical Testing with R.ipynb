    "Building a hypothesis is one of the first steps in starting in the analysis of experiments, it is all about **answering a question**. Of course, before building a hypothesis is always nice to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get more insight into what information is available and what lies within the data."

    "\n",
    "> [...] **if** and **then** [...] are necessary in formalized hypothesis. [...] In a formalized hypothesis, a tentative relationship is stated. [...] Formalized hypotheses contain two variables. One is \"independent\" and the other is \"dependent\". The independent variable is the one you, the \"scientist\" control, and the dependent variable is the one that you observe and/or measure the results.

    "This warning is related to small samples in our population, so we are having poor estimates; but fear not, another statistical test that we can use in this scenario is the [**Fisher Test**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426219/#__sec5title):\n",

While the chi-squared test relies on an approximation, Fisher's exact test is one of exact tests. Especially when more than 20% of cells have expected frequencies < 5, we need to use Fisher's exact test because applying approximation method is inadequate. Fisher's exact test assesses the null hypothesis of independence applying hypergeometric distribution of the numbers in the cells of the table.\n",
